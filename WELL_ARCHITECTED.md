## 🎯 Serverless Design Principles Compliance

### ✅ **Speedy, Simple, Singular**
Functions are focused, single-purpose, and optimized for fast execution.

### ✅ **Think Concurrent Requests**
Design considers Lambda concurrency model with proper error handling.

### ✅ **Share Nothing**
Stateless design with external state properly managed in DynamoDB/S3.

### ✅ **Assume No Hardware Affinity**
Code is hardware-agnostic, leveraging ARM64 for efficiency.

### ⚠️ **Orchestrate with State Machines**
**Gap**: Complex workflows should use Step Functions instead of Lambda chaining.

### ✅ **Use Events to Trigger Transactions**
API Gateway provides event-driven request handling.

### ✅ **Design for Failures and Duplicates**
Comprehensive error handling and idempotent operation design.
